# Healthdex 
## Questions to ponder !! 

- Is there a system available for patients to view all their medical records at one place?
- Is there a system where hospitals can share the medical records of a patient without requiring to conduct the same tests again?<br />

We, the team Specter have come up with an idea addressing these questions. We are happy to present Healthdex, a service that helps to keep track of the medical history of patients accross any number of hospitals

Our product allows patient to see their medical records from the hospitals they visited. It also allows doctors to view the medical history of patients so that they can perform a quick diagnosis
