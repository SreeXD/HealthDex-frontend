# Healthdex 
## Questions to ponder !! 

- Is there a system available for patients to view all their medical records at one place?
- Is there a system where hospitals can share the medical records of a patient without requiring to conduct the same tests again?<br />
We, the team Specter have come up with an idea addressing these questions. We are happy to present Healthdex, a service that helps to keep track of the medical history of patients accross any number of hospitals<br />

Our product allows patient to see their medical records from the hospitals they visited. It also allows doctors to view the medical history of patients so that they can perform a quick diagnosis
